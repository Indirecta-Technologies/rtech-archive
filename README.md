# rtech-archive
## An archive/vault/conservation effort containing various models produced by the Roblox Tech Community

### What is the Roblox Tech Community?
The RTECH or RTEC has emerged spontaneously many times, probably from the Pinewood Builders era, to the Ae Security and Orwae Groups, to a small isolated community that
lives near the Stage/Light community (Inertia Lightning, etc.) and the Lift community (Luxiar, OTIS AP, etc.).

The current isolated community has seen a vast range of products, from fire alarms produced by Orwae, to Theta Technologies, etcetera.

The purpose of this repository is to store and archive as many of these open sourced jewels as possible, which could also be curated over the time.

The RTECH Community is made of different categories:

- Fire Alarms (Custom or Recreated like Simplex or Notifier)
- Stage or Lightning
- Sound
- Lift (Controversial)
- Miscelleaneous

The Fire Alarm community usually is
A. Open source freemodels that work using an RFS script system with ObjectValues, Events, etc.
B. Isolated open source paid or secretely distributed models given as files, typically given by CBA Alarm Technologies using a more advanced version of RFS
C. Open source or obfuscated addressable original systems like Orwae Harmony, or Theta Valiant, using new BindableEvents instead of values

Every model or place that is submitted must have:
- A Story
- A Date
- A Name
- Authenticity
- Unobfuscated scripts
- A file
- Possible mesh files, can also be extracted
